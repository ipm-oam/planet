## How to Add your file to your fork?

- Fork this repository.

- Clone your fork.

- Add an empty file e.g.:

```sh
touch my_name
```

- Add your file to your local copy of the repository:

```sh
git add my_name
```

- Commit your changes:

```sh
git commit -m "Hi! I add my name!"
```

- Push your changes to github:

```sh
git push
```

## Make a pull request

- First sync your fork with the upstream, using the *sync fork* drop-down button. If it's synced skip this part.
- Click on the *contribute* drop-down button and then *open pull request*. 
- In the new window, as the upstream just has the main branch, you do not need to change any thing in the compare part and you should see the *Able to merge* tick.
- Please leave a comment for the upstream maintainer.
- Then click on the *create pull request* button.
- In the new window, click on *Merge pull request* and confirm it.
